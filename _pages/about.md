Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Before UW, I was a research assistant supervised by Prof. [Wang, Hsin-Min](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/whm/index_en.html), Prof. [Tsao, Yu](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yu.tsao/index_en.html), Prof. [Ko, Ming-Tat](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/mtko/index_en.html) at the Institue of Information Science, Academia Sinica. I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech)](https://www-en.ntut.edu.tw) in June 2021.
