I am currently a research assistant supervised by Prof. [Wang, Hsin-Min](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/whm/index_en.html) and Prof. [Ko, Ming-Tat](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/mtko/index_en.html) in [SLAM Laboratory](http://slam.iis.sinica.edu.tw) at the Institue of Information Science, Academia Sinica. I received B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech)](https://www-en.ntut.edu.tw) in June 2021.

Prior to that, I was a data engineer intern at [LINE Taiwan](https://linecorp.com/en/), I develop NLP tools to solve real-world problems. Before I pivoted to the field of NLP, I was a software developer intern in [iCook](https://icook.tw) and [Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com) where I learned the foundations of software development.

My research interests are Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Spoken Language Processing (SLP). My goal is to break language barriers via language technologies. Here are the applications that I have been working with: Language Model, Machine Translation, Automatica Speech Recognition, and Speech Translation.
